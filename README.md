# SLPP - Shangri-La Petition Platform

## Project Description
Citizens in the Valley of Shangri-La now have a new way to shape parliamentary discussion through the
Shangri-La Petition Platform (SLPP). This platform allows citizens of Shangri-La to create or sign petitions on matter within the government’s responsibility. Any citizen can propose a petition on topics they care about.
Once a petition reaches the signature threshold set by the Petitions Committee, it then qualifies for
parliamentary debate. After the debate, the Petitions Committee issues a summary response of behalf of the Parliament before formally closing the petition. Your task is to design and implement the SLPP, which can be developed as either an app or a website.
